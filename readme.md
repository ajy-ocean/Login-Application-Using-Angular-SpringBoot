# JWT Authentication with Angular and Spring Boot

## Overview

This application demonstrates a simple JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication system built with Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application allows users to log in, obtain a JWT token, and access protected resources. It showcases how to handle user authentication, authorization, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular, Angular Material
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT
- **Database**: (Specify if you are using a database, e.g., H2, MySQL, etc.)

## Features

- **User Login**: Users can log in using their credentials, receiving a JWT token upon successful authentication.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain API endpoints are protected and require a valid JWT token to access.
- **CORS Handling**: CORS is configured to allow requests from the Angular frontend to the Spring Boot backend.
- **User Management**: A simple interface to fetch and display user details from the backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK (Java Development Kit) 11 or higher
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Angular CLI (for Angular development)
- A compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code)
